## Task description:

Almost every day, the media reminds us that Croats are among the fattest and least healthy in Europe. About 60% of Croatian women and 70% of Croatian men can be considered overweight according to the body mass index. In 2019, only 60% of Croats (three out of five people) stated that they were in good health, and this share is lower than the average of the European Union, where 69% of people consider themselves to be healthy. We don't move enough, we don't eat healthy, and we also have a large proportion of smokers, which consequently leads to lung cancer being the most common form of cancer in Croatia. As if all that is not enough, we do not take enough care of mental health either, and as many as 160000 people in Croatia suffer from depression, while on a global level every fourth person suffers from some mental health problem. Only through joint efforts can we overcome these challenges and improve the quality of life of all citizens. According to all the above, your task at this hackathon is:
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE

The above-mentioned problems can be solved in many ways: through education about healthy eating, encouraging people to be physically active, openness to mental health, and the like (don't limit yourself to the above!). Let's think of phenomena like PokÃ©mon GO and Geocaching, which successfully motivated people to be more active through the game. It is crucial that your solution is accessible to the largest possible audience, that it is motivating and that it leads people on the right path to making healthy decisions. Your solution is not limited by technology, specific features or the platform you develop for. Show the creativity of the solution, but make sure that it is sustainable and that it can really come to life in the target audience. The jury will evaluate your creativity and innovation, as well as technical characteristics (complexity and polishedness of the solution). You have 24 hours.
